John led a private life focused on his family and business until December, 1996 when his youngest daughter, six year old JonBene't, was brutally murdered in Boulder, Colorado.  The crime drew chaotic international media attention for years following  and cruel public accusations of Ramsey, his wife Patsy, and their 9 year old son by an inexperienced local police department.  He weathered injustice than few have experienced with grace, dignity and God's guidance, maintained strong leadership of his family, and strengthened his faith  throughout the lengthy ordeal.  Twelve years later he and his family were officially cleared by the District Attorney and a written apology was issued  for the hardships caused by the careless treatment of his family by the police.
